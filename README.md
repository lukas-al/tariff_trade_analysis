# MPIL Tariff Trade Analysis
- Bottom up network analysis of tariff impacts, second order, redistribution, scenarios, etc.

## TODO:
- Detrend series
- Join MACMAPS and validate the tariff time series
- What's the effect size?
    - Baseline
    - Control for fixed effects
    - Etc.
- Diversion
    - What's a case of diversion?
    - How can we apply the network to identify cases of diversion and diagnose them?
- Network state: s1 vs s2
    - Is the network more resilient than it once was?
    - Can we model second-order effects?
    - If this is an embargo - how does the network evolve from state 1 to state 2?
        - Sink / source model, multidimensional
        - Path / flow finding algorithm
        - Set up extreme scenarios for the network. View the re-orientation.
        - Application of 'residual graph'
