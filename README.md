# MPIL Tariff Trade Analysis
- Bottom up network analysis of tariff impacts, second order, redistribution, scenarios, etc.

## TODO:
- [ ] Reconcile between CEPII-BACI's weird ISO country codes and the WITS version
- [ ] Re-structure the joining to properly account for the relationship between export and import duty. We're currently missing some values.
- [ ] Deal with the EU block, and other trade blocks. I believe the EU countries are missing from the tariff data. 
- [ ] Complete research outline and circulate for feedback
