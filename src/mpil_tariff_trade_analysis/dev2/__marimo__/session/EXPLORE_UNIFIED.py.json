How much substitution to lower-tariff countries is there?</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Considerations:</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we want all data points to count the same? Do we want to preferentially weight larger import volumes? Can we just remove very small imports.</li>\n<li>Different categories have different dynamics, e.g. commodities vs specialist goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>How many 'tariff shocks' exist?</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">For countries with import volumes above a certain size, how many 'tariff shocks' (some metric similar to the US imposition) can we identify?</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Considertations:</span>\n<ul>\n<li>What's a tariff shock</li>\n<li>What countries count, volumes &amp; values, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Trade Deflection - case study across countries and time</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">When tariffs cause imports to be deflected to other countries, how do those exporters react? Are there patterns in how they choose countries to redirect to? (Open economies, nearby, etc).</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Considerations:</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to control for the imposition of reciprocal tariffs to understand effect sizes - conditional on no reciprocation, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Second-order impacts</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Can we calculate the impact of cost passthroughs in supply chains? E.g. if export prices for good X from China increase by 10%, the direct impact is that import prices for that good in the UK from China also increase 10%. But if the good is used to produce X,Y,Z products in Germany, what is the impact on prices of goods which the UK imports from Germany?</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Would need to use inter-country I/O tables or some such.</span>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Non-linearities in cost passthrough</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Are manufacturers more likely to pass through cost increases to consumers due to tariffs? Has this ratio stayed the same? Is there reason to think we're in a more sensitive regime?</span>\n<h1 id=\"considerations\">Considerations:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with UK, China, US</li>\n<li>Use 2018 case study</li>\n</ol></span>"
